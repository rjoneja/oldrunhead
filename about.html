    <p>Runhead AC came about 5 years ago when 4 friends decided they wanted to run and have a beer each week. <br><br>

There's always lots to do so if you fancy helping out then say hello by emailing us at

<u>FAQs</u>
<br><br>


<b>How fast do I need to be?</b>
Everyone is welcome!<br>
<b>Do you do anything other than Tuesday evening runs?</b>
Lots! Last year we had 150 runners at The Big Half marathon followed by a cracking party at Brick Brewery. We also volunteer and pace at Parkrun. And there's been trips to Wales, the Netherlands and Sweden
<br>
<b>What happens if I don't like beer?</b>
The Old Nuns Head sell plenty of other drinks (hard and soft) but we also won't be offended if you don't want to stick around after the run.<br>
<b>Who organises Runhead?</b>
There's lots of lovely people that volunteer to lead (and pace) runs each week which is really the core thing. Outside of that there are also people that take care of the admin (membership lists, kit supplies) as well as various people coming up with things such as a bake sale on an ad-hoc basis.
